# Center Gossip Frame

Center Gossip Frame centralizes the following frames on the screen:

* Gossip Frame
* Quest Frame

This addon was designed to make it easier for players to interact with NPCs
and quest givers by centralizing the frames that are usually displayed on the
left side of the screen and that can be hard to see when the player is using
a large and wide monitor.

## Available commands

For now, there are no commands available for this addon.

## What's on the roadmap for the next versions

* **Cover more frames:** I'm aware there are lots of frames that could be also
  centralized, but they'll be added in future versions.
* **Automatic repositioning:** In some cases, players may want to preview the
  quest rewards before turning in the quest. In these cases, the game will add
  a closet on the right side of the quest frame and move it back to the left
  side. Automatic repositionings like those are not yet supported by the addon.
* **Option to disable the addon:** There is no option to disable the addon
  in-game. Players who want to disable it will need to deactivate it.
